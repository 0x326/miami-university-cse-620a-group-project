	abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of the resilient control for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of malicious sensor denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which result in the loss of state information. The concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration are introduced to describe the DoS attacks. According to the attack situation, that is, whether the attack is successfully implemented or not, the original physical system is rewritten as a switched version. A resilient sliding mode control scheme is designed to guarantee that the physical process is exponentially stable, which is a foundation of the main results. Then, a zero-sum game is employed to establish an effective mixed defense mechanism. Furthermore, a defense-based resilient sliding mode control scheme is proposed and the desired control performance is achieved. Compared with the existing results, the differences mainly lie in two aspects, that is, one where a switched model is obtained, based on which the average dwell-time like approach is utilized to derive the resilient control scheme, and the other where the zero-sum game in employed to make the attacks satisfy the concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control approach.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {The recent years have seen a surge of security issues of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, denial-of-service (DoS) attack scheduling is investigated in depth. Specifically, we consider a system where a remote estimator receives the data packet sent by a sensor over a wireless network at each time instant, and an energy-constrained attacker that cannot launch DoS attacks all the time designs the optimal DoS attack scheduling to maximize the attacking effect on the remote estimation performance. Most of the existing works concerning DoS attacks focus on the ideal scenario in which data packets can be received successfully if there is no DoS attack. To capture the unreliability nature of practical networks, we study the packet-dropping network in which packet dropouts may occur even in the absence of attack. We derive the optimal attack scheduling scheme that maximizes the average expected estimation error, and the one which maximizes the expected terminal estimation error over packet-dropping networks. We also present some countermeasures against DoS attacks, and discuss the optimal defense strategy, and how the optimal attack schedule can serve for more effective and resource-saving countermeasures. We further investigate the optimal attack schedule with multiple sensors. The optimality of the theoretical results is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

@article{Miao2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we establish a zero-sum, hybrid state stochastic game model for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against different types of attacks. With the increasingly integrated properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) today, security is a challenge for critical infrastructures. Though resilient control and detecting techniques for a specific model of attack have been proposed, to analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms against multiple types of attacks for CPSs requires new system frameworks. Besides security, other requirements such as optimal control cost also need to be considered. The hybrid game model we propose contains physical states that are described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system composed by a set of subsystems. A strategy means selecting a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. Based on the game model, we propose a suboptimal value iteration algorithm for a finite horizon game, and prove that the algorithm results an upper bound for the value of the finite horizon game. A moving-horizon approach is also developed in order to provide a scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies. Both algorithms aim at obtaining a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously system designs that only equipped with one type of controller.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of resilient control of networked control system (NCS) under denial-of-service (DoS) attack via a unified game approach. The DoS attacks lead to extra constraints in the NCS, where the packets may be jammed by a malicious adversary. Considering the attack-induced packet dropout, optimal control strategies with multitasking and central-tasking structures are developed using game theory in the delta domain, respectively. Based on the optimal control structures, we propose optimality criteria and algorithms for both cyber defenders and DoS attackers. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure.},

abstract = {This paper studies a resilient control problem for discrete-time, linear time-invariant systems subject to state and input constraints. State measurements and control laws are transmitted over a communication network and could be corrupted by human adversaries. In particular, we consider a class of human adversaries, namely correlated jammers, who are modeled as rational decision makers and whose strategies are highly correlated to the control system operator. The coupled decision making process is modeled as a two-level receding-horizon dynamic Stackelberg (leader-follower) game. We propose a receding-horizon Stackelberg control law for the operator, and analyze the resulting performance and closed-loop stability of the system under correlated attacks. We observe that, with full information of his follower, the operator is still able to maintain regional stability of the control system. {\textcopyright} 2011 AACC American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract = {The issue of cyber-security has become ever more prevalent in the analysis and design of networked systems. In this paper, we analyze networked control systems in the presence of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, namely attacks that prevent transmissions over the network. We characterize frequency and duration of the DoS attacks under which input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system can be preserved. To achieve ISS, a suitable scheduling of the transmission times is determined. It is shown that the considered framework is flexible enough so as to allow the designer to choose from several implementation options that can be used for trading-off performance versus communication resources. Examples are given to substantiate the analysis.},

These malicious DoS attacks are intended to interfere with the communication channel causing periods in time at which transmission of measurement data is impossible. We show that the proposed ETC scheme, if well designed, can tolerate a class of DoS signals characterized by frequency and duration properties without jeopardizing the stability, performance and Zeno-freeness of the ETC system. In fact, the design procedure of the ETC condition allows tradeoffs between performance, robustness to DoS attacks, and utilization of communication resources. The main results will be illustrated by means of a numerical example.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a resilient event-triggering H(infinity) load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems with energy-limited Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The LFC design specifically takes the presence of DoS attacks into account. First, an area control error dependent time delay model is delicately constructed for multi-area closed-loop power systems. Second, a resilient event-triggering communication (RETC) scheme is well designed, which allows a degree of packet losses induced by DoS attacks and has the advantage of improving the transaction efficiency. Then, by using the Lyapunov theory, two stability and stabilization criteria for the multi-area power systems are derived under consideration of the energy-limited DoS attacks. In these criteria, the relationship between the allowable DoS attack duration and the resilient event-triggering communication parameters are clearly revealed. Moreover, an algorithm is also provided to obtain the RETC parameters and the LFC gains simultaneously. Finally, a case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

@article{Wu2020,
abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of the resilient control for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of malicious sensor denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which result in the loss of state information. The concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration are introduced to describe the DoS attacks. According to the attack situation, that is, whether the attack is successfully implemented or not, the original physical system is rewritten as a switched version. A resilient sliding mode control scheme is designed to guarantee that the physical process is exponentially stable, which is a foundation of the main results. Then, a zero-sum game is employed to establish an effective mixed defense mechanism. Furthermore, a defense-based resilient sliding mode control scheme is proposed and the desired control performance is achieved. Compared with the existing results, the differences mainly lie in two aspects, that is, one where a switched model is obtained, based on which the average dwell-time like approach is utilized to derive the resilient control scheme, and the other where the zero-sum game in employed to make the attacks satisfy the concepts of DoS frequency and DoS duration. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilient control approach.},
